/**
 * What a template sees, and what the helpers see. Two objects on purpose.
 *
 * The context is what a template author may read as a path, and it holds
 * three things about the card and nothing about its values: which card
 * type, which system, which language — for a class on the root, a branch a
 * design needs. Every value a face shows goes through a helper: `slot` for
 * a value, `slot-label` for its caption, `slot-class` for a class chosen by
 * it, `t` for a translation, `asset` for a file. The template never names a
 * property, which is what lets a card type rename, alias or re-bind its data
 * without a face noticing.
 *
 * The state is what those helpers need, and it travels in the Handlebars
 * data frame rather than in the context, so that a template cannot reach it
 * as a path and the context stays exactly what an author is meant to see.
