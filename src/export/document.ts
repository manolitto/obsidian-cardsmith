 * The export document: a deck's pages as one self-contained HTML file.

 * The same document is what the PDF is printed from and what the HTML
 * export saves — a browser opening either shows the sheets as they print.
 * It is static: every face arrives settled from the layout engine, every
 * picture and font is a data URI, and nothing runs on load. Its own CSS is
 * the page geometry and the few rules that keep Chromium's print engine
 * honest; the cards' look is the card-type stylesheets, carried as they
 * are, with their `@font-face` rules lifted out and written once.
