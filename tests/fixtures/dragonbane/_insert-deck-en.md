# The vault folder whose card notes are the deck — one, or a list of several. Default: the deck note's own folder; "" is the vault root.
# folder:

# A note must carry every one of these tags.
# include-tags-all:

# A note must carry at least one of these tags.
# include-tags-any:

# A note carrying any one of these tags is left out.
# exclude-tags-any:

# A note carrying every one of these tags is left out.
# exclude-tags-all:

# Only the cards that print in one of these languages. Default: every card.
# card-languages:

# Where the exports go, with either extension. Default: beside the deck note, under its name.
# output-path:

# A sheet (A3, A4, A5, Letter, Legal), a card size (poker, tarot, … — one card per page) or `210 x 297 mm`; a preset alone lets the deck pick the orientation that holds more cards.
# paper-size: A4

# Blank space around the card grid, in millimetres. Yields where the paper is too small for it; the card never does.
# page-margin: 10

# Which paper edge is the binding when printing duplex, so fronts and backs align: `long-edge` or `short-edge`.
# duplex-flip: long-edge

# The cut marks at every card corner; the fields merge, so one can change alone.
# cut-marks: {enabled: true, length: 3, margin: 0, color: '#aaaaaa', weight: 0.25}

# `textured` prints the system's background pictures, `plain` leaves them out. Default: the plugin setting.
# paper-background:

# Include the subfolders of every folder.
# folder-recursive: true

# Copies per card by note name, winning over a card's own `copies`: `[{ name: Wolf, copies: 3 }]`.
# card-copies:

# A preset (mini, bridge, poker, tarot, dixit, large) or `63 x 88 mm`, either followed by `landscape`.
# card-size: poker

# What a card does when its text does not fit at the smallest type size: `none` clips, `extra-cards` continues on further cards, `back-then-cards` fills the back first.
# overflow-mode: none

# The named ways the card may be laid out; a design's concern.
# layouts: [{name: default, front-face-count: any, fallback: true}]

# How the winning layout is chosen; a design's concern.
# layout-decision: {order: [{metric: printed-cards, direction: minimize}], tie-break: declaration-order}

# Which faces the card has, in the preview and in a deck: `front`, `back` or `both`.
# side: both

# Height of the in-note preview, in pixels.
# display-height:

# How many times the card is printed in a deck.
# copies:

# Print one card per value of the roll range between `roll-min` and `roll-max`.
# expand-by-roll: false

# The language the card is printed in — which translation table its captions come from.
