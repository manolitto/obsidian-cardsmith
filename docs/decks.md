# Decks

A deck is a folder of card notes and a note beside them that carries a
`cardsmith-deck` block. The block says which notes are in, how they are
ordered and how they go onto paper; the plugin lays the cards out, puts
them on pages and writes a PDF or an HTML file.

````yaml from=tests/fixtures/simple/_deck.md
```cardsmith-deck
system: simple
```
````

That is a complete deck: every card note of the `simple` system in the
deck note's own folder, on A4 in whichever orientation holds more cards.
Everything else has a default. *Insert deck block* in the command palette
writes a block with every key as a comment, each with its explanation.

## Which notes

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `system` | Required. Notes of another system are left out. |
| `card-type` | One id or a list. Only notes of these card types; the list is also the print order of the groups. Default: every card type. |
| `folder` | The folder whose card notes are the deck. Default: the deck note's own; `""` is the vault root. |
| `folder-recursive` | `true` includes the folder's subfolders. |
| `include-tags-all`, `include-tags-any`, `exclude-tags-any`, `exclude-tags-all` | Tag filters on the notes' tags, written as Obsidian shows them (`#Waffe` or `Waffe`, either). |
| `card-languages` | Only the cards that print in one of these languages. |

A note is in the deck when its block's `system` is the deck's, its card
type is listed (or none is), the tag filters agree and its language is
listed (or none is).

## Order, and copies

Cards print grouped by card type — in the order of the block's
`card-type:` list, else the system's order. Within a group, cards with a
roll range come first, ascending; then by name, numerically aware, so
`Wolf 2` precedes `Wolf 10`.

A card prints once unless its own `copies` says otherwise, and the deck can
override that by name:

```yaml
card-copies:
  - { name: Wolf, copies: 3 }
```

A card that spilled onto three faces printed twice is six physical cards,
consecutively.

## The paper

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `paper-size` | A preset (`A3`, `A4`, `A5`, `Letter`, `Legal`) or `210 x 297 mm`. A preset alone lets the deck pick the orientation that holds more cards; `A4 portrait` fixes it. |
| `page-margin` | Blank space around the card grid, in millimetres. |
| `cut-marks` | `{enabled: true, length: 3, margin: 0, color: '#aaaaaa', weight: 0.25}` — a cross at every card corner, its arms `length` mm along the cuts and `margin` mm clear of the corner, printed over the cards. The fields merge, so one can change alone. |
| `duplex-flip` | Which edge is the binding when printing duplex, `long-edge` or `short-edge`, so a back lands behind its front. |
| `paper-background` | `textured` prints the system's background pictures, `plain` leaves them out. Default: the plugin setting. |

The cards are packed without gaps on one grid and centred inside the
margin. A paper the size of the card prints one borderless card — for
digital play.

## The cards' settings

Every card setting a note may write, a deck block may write too:
`card-size`, `overflow-mode`, `side`, `language`, `copies` and the rest
(see [Cards](cards.md)). A deck's value beats the card type's; a note's
own value beats the deck's — with one exception. **A deck is one grid,
so it is one card size:** a deck block that names `card-size` prints
every card at it and reports each note it overrode. A deck of two sizes
without the key refuses to export, naming both.

`side: front` on the deck prints fronts only, and the deck has no back
pages then.

## Pages

Pages come in print order: a sheet's front, then its back — when any card
in the deck has one. On the back page every card sits where its front
lands after the flip, so a duplex print aligns from the first sheet to the
last. A deck without backs prints no blank sheets.

## The block in reading view

The deck block shows a summary — system, card types, folder, how many
notes it found and of which types, paper, card size — and three buttons:

- **Preview** builds the deck — the button counts the cards as they
  render and lay out — and opens it in a pane of its own, the pages
  scaled to the pane's width, with *Rebuild* in the toolbar.
- **Export PDF** builds the deck and prints it: fronts and backs on
  alternating pages, the paper the block says. The file lands beside the
  deck note under its name (or at `output-path`) and opens in a new pane.
  Desktop only.
- **Export HTML** writes the same pages as one self-contained file,
  fonts and pictures included, and opens it in whatever the system opens
  HTML with — the browser, with its print dialog, on the desktop and on a
  phone alike. Obsidian itself shows no HTML; its file explorer lists the
  file only with *Detect all file extensions* switched on under *Files
  and links*.

The same three are commands in the palette, for the deck note that is
open: *Preview deck*, *Export deck as PDF*, *Export deck as HTML*.

Whatever the build had to report — a note it overrode, a card cut at the
type floor, a picture it did not find — is counted in a notice and listed
in the developer console.
