/*
 * The overflow splitter: what happens when a body does not fit its face even
 * at the type floor.
 *
 * When `scaleOneBody` reports a body clipped at `--card-font-size-min`, the
 * splitter walks the direct children of `.card-body-scalable` and moves the
 * trailing content into a second container — a front-template clone rendered
 * onto the back, or a freshly spawned card's body — until every face fits at
 * one locked scale.
 *
 * The overflow modes (`OverflowMode` in the settings chain):
 *   "none"            — no split; the body clips and the caller warns.
 *   "extra-cards"     — spawn front/back pairs.
 *   "back-then-cards" — clone the front onto the back, then spawn cards. A
 *                       layout candidate with `front-face-count: odd | even`
 *                       paginates onto front faces only and pads the front
 *                       count to that parity: `odd` re-appends the designed
 *                       back as the final face (odd fronts + 1 back = even →
 *                       clean duplex), `even` appends none. `any` keeps plain
 *                       back-then-cards.
 *
 * The committed layout candidate is stamped on every card-root as the CSS hook
 * class `.cs-layout-<name>` (`csApplyLayoutClasses`), applied BEFORE
 * measurement so templates can safely show or hide body content keyed on it.
 * A set that names its parity candidates `odd` / `even` therefore gets
 * `.cs-layout-odd` / `.cs-layout-even` as its parity hooks.
 *
 * The splitter works on a host: a container holding one `.cs-face` wrapper per
 * face — the front first, the back second — each wrapping a `.card-root`. It
 * appends further `.cs-face` wrappers to the same container as it spawns
 * cards. Everything here reads layout, like the font scaler it builds on.

 * splitter can know them, and that is what decides what CSS may hang on each.
 *
 * `cs-front-continued` is knowable the moment a face is spawned — a face that
 * receives a tail is a continuation, whatever the group turns out to hold — so
 * it is stamped there, BEFORE that face is measured, and a system may size a
 * continuation's chrome differently. A slim repeat-plaque is the obvious use:
 * from the second face on the title is a locator, not a headline. Measuring
 * the face against the plaque it will actually print is the only way that face
 * fills. Stamped afterwards, the head shrinks after the cut has been made and
 * the face keeps the room the taller plaque had cost it — a page ending
 * emptier than the one before it, for no reason a reader can see.
 *
 * `cs-front-has-next` cannot be known that early: whether a face is the last
 * one depends on how much the faces after it turn out to hold. It stays a
 * CHROME-ONLY hook, stamped after the pass, and must NOT gate front-body

 * the head collapses to what preceded it: two stat lines, 7 of 282 words, 2 % of

 * is a straight trade of clean block boundaries against empty space — a value
 * with no right answer, only a taste. Measured over an Eiserne-Zeit spell deck

 * `--cs-front-total` props — BOTH applied in finalizeGroup, AFTER the split has
 * already chosen how much body content stays on each face. Because the counter

 * title (e.g. a long compound name pinned at the title-min floor) onto an extra
 * line, growing the header and shrinking the body's available height below what
 * the splitter budgeted — clipping the trailing block the splitter measured as
 * fitting. finalizeGroup's relayout re-fits the title but never re-splits, so
 * the clip stands.
 *
 * Activating the counter here makes the MEASURED header height already include
 * it, so the committed split fits. With `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` the
 * counter's width is constant for single-digit counts (the overwhelmingly common
 * case), so the "1 / 2" placeholder matches the eventual "X / N" width;
 * finalizeGroup overwrites the props with the real values (same width → no
 * re-wrap). The measured title sits at its pre-finalize (larger-or-equal) font,
 * so the final scaleTitles pass can only keep the header at the measured height
 * or shrink it — never grow it past the budget. A card-type with no counter
 * placeholder is unaffected (nothing renders under `.cs-overflow-active`).
 *
 * Always correct to apply: performSplit only runs once the single card already
 * overflows at the scale floor, so the committed group always has >1 face and
 * the counter always ends up shown. Clones spawned below inherit the class +
 * props via `innerHTML`; the guard skips re-setting an inherited placeholder. */

 * lets this run early where the page-number markers cannot. A system that
 * gives a continuation a shallower head therefore gets the room it frees
 * counted into the cut, rather than handed to the face after the cut was
 * already decided.
 *
 * The title has to be re-fitted for the class to mean anything geometrically.
 * The face is cloned from the snapshot, which carries the first face's titles
 * at the INLINE size the scaler committed for them, and an inline size beats
 * the cascade — so a continuation rule that sets a smaller title changes
 * nothing until the title is scaled again. It shows up only on the cards whose
 * titles were scaled at all, i.e. the long ones, which is why it hides: a
 * short title sits at its cascade size on both faces and the class bites
 * immediately, while a two-line title keeps face 1's size through the
 * measurement, then drops to the continuation size in the final relayout and
 * takes a line and a half of head with it — after the cut. `scaleFontSize`
 * clears the inline size and re-fits from the cascade, so one pass over this
 * face is all it takes, and the group relayout later finds it already there.

 *
 * Preconditions: `srcBody` already has FontScaler applied (transform + width +
 * height stretch). The body's content overflows at the current scale (caller
 * has verified `scrollHeight > clientHeight`).
 *
 * The natural breakpoints are BETWEEN the body's top-level blocks. The
 * algorithm:
 *   1. Keeps the largest prefix of WHOLE blocks that fit (`k`).
 *   2. Looks at the first block that doesn't fit whole — the boundary block
 *      `B = blocks[k]`. If `B` is atomic (keep-together / media / ≤1 word /
 *      table) it is moved WHOLE to the tail along with every following block.
 *      Only when `B` is splittable multi-word prose is it word-split, keeping
 *      as many of its leading words as fit and flowing the remainder.
 *   3. A single Range from the chosen start to end-of-body extracts the
 *      tail-of-B (when split) plus all trailing whole blocks in one fragment.
 *
 * So a wrapped part (e.g. a names table) stays on the current face if IT fits,
 * and only moves as a whole if IT does not — it is never dragged across the
 * boundary just because some later block (an image) doesn't fit.
 *
 * Returns `{ moved: 0/1, remainsClipped: bool }`. `remainsClipped: true` means
 * even a near-empty face can't hold the first block (pathological — an
 * oversized atomic block at the body start); the caller's spawn loop then
 * stops rather than looping forever.
 *
 * The body's own inline styles (transform / width / height / min-height) are
 * preserved across `innerHTML` resets because they live on the body element
 * itself, not on its children. */

 * empty the face), so a marker that can only be honoured by emptying the face is
 * a no-op, accepted as a last resort, mirroring the keep-together fallback.
 *
 * Requires `body` in its PRISTINE state (block indices read off the live DOM).
 * Both markers only fire at whole-block boundaries: in the word-split path the
 * intent is already satisfied — a keep-with-next predecessor is immediately
 * followed on the SAME face by the boundary block's surviving head, and a
