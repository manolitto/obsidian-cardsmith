  image:

  # Empty boxes to tick off with a pen. A number (`20`), a labelled row (`{ count: 20, label: Arrows }`) or a list of such rows. `group` (default 5) sets how many boxes stand together.

  # List of traits — creature type, themes, rarity. Each entry becomes a pill; the rarities `ungewöhnlich`, `selten` and `einzigartig` take the rarity colour.

  # Perception modifier as a plain integer; the sign is added when printed.
  perception:

  # Special senses as free text (e.g. `darkvision`, `low-light vision`, `lifesense 60 ft.`), after the perception modifier.

  resistances:

  # Weaknesses as free text in the form `damage-type value`, comma-separated (e.g. `holy 5`).
  weaknesses:

  # Simple movement as free text (e.g. `20 feet`, `25 ft.`). The card puts the ⬻ action glyph in front — do not write it into the value. For several movement modes use `speed` instead.
  stride:

  # Full movement line as free text when the creature has several movement modes (e.g. `30 ft., climb 20 ft., fly 40 ft.`). No action glyph; use only when `stride` is not set.
  speed:

  # The creature's attacks, actions and abilities as a list. Each entry is an object of optional fields; the card prints what is set:
  #
