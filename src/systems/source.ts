 * Where a system's files come from.

 * Two implementations, one interface: a bundled system reads out of the
 * manifest embedded in the plugin, a vault system reads through Obsidian's
 * adapter. Everything above this line — the loader, its checks, the stylesheet
 * assembly, later the template engine — sees only this, so a system behaves
 * the same whichever way it arrived.
 *
 * Async throughout, even though the manifest could answer synchronously: the
 * adapter is I/O, and the interface is shaped by the slower of its two
 * implementations.
 *
 * Every path is a `SystemPath` — relative to the system folder, checked to
 * stay inside it. A source is never handed a string nobody checked.
 *
 * The root document is whatever the registration points at — the listing
 * entry of a bundled system, the file the user picked for a vault one —
 * and the folder holding it is the system. The name is free: the bundled
 * systems call theirs after the system, and nothing is found by name.
