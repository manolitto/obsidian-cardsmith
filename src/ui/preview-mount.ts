/*
 * Settled faces on the screen, at a display height.
 *
 * The layout engine has already done everything that measures: every face
 * arrives with its title fitted, its body scaled, its pictures faded. What
 * is left is to show them — each face in a box of the card's size in CSS
 * pixels, scaled by `transform` to the height the reader asked for, under
 * the card type's stylesheet in a shadow root so the card's CSS and
 * Obsidian's never touch. A shadow root cannot load a font, so the
 * `@font-face` rules are hoisted into the document's head the way the
 * layout host does it; a system's fonts are parsed once per document
 * however many previews show it. Plain paper is the same hook the export
 * stamps on its pages, `cs-paper-plain`, here on the faces' wrapper: the
 * card shows what the printer would print.
 *
 * DOM only: no Obsidian, no measurement, no scaling of text.
